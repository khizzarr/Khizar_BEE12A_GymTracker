### Description

This project implements a real-time pose estimation and gym tracking system using AI and computer vision techniques on webcam footage. It enables users to promptly assess their exercise form and performance, meeting the demand for tech-powered fitness solutions.

### Abstract

This project's goal is to create an AI-driven system for pose estimation and gym tracking via computer vision techniques on webcam feeds. With the fusion of fitness and technology, there's an increasing need for inventive solutions delivering instant feedback on exercise form and performance. The project's challenge lies in accurately estimating human poses during workouts, providing users with valuable insights into their movements for effective gym tracking.

### Methodology

**Research Methods:** Employing a mix of literature review and experimentation, the project will explore existing pose estimation algorithms and gym tracking methodologies to guide its development.

**Experimental Design:** Starting with fundamental pose estimation, the project will progressively integrate functionalities like real-time tracking and exercise form analysis.

**Tools and Technologies:** Primarily utilizing OpenCV for computer vision tasks, especially pose estimation, the project might integrate machine learning frameworks to boost accuracy in pose estimation and gym tracking. Additional libraries may be incorporated as the project advances.

**Data Collection and Analysis:** Gathering workout session data encompassing various exercises and body movements, the analysis will focus on pose estimation accuracy, real-time performance, and overall user experience.

**Validation and Testing:** The system's efficacy in delivering accurate pose estimations and valuable workout insights will be assessed through user testing to validate its performance.
