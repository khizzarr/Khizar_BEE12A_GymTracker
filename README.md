## Description

This project implements an AI-powered system for real-time pose estimation and gym tracking using computer vision techniques applied to webcam footage. It offers users immediate insights into their exercise form and performance, addressing the demand for technology-driven fitness solutions.

## Abstract:
This project aims to develop an AI-powered pose estimation and gym tracking system using computer vision techniques applied to webcam footage. As fitness becomes increasingly integrated with technology, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions that provide realtime feedback on exercise form and performance. The challenge addressed in this project is to create a system that accurately estimates human poses during workout sessions, offering users valuable insights into their movements and facilitating effective gym tracking.

## Methodology:
Research Methods:
The project will employ a combination of literature review and experimentation. Existing pose estimation algorithms and gym tracking methodologies will be explored to inform the development process.
##Experimental Design:
We will start with basic pose estimation and gradually incorporate features such as real-time tracking and exercise form analysis.
## Tools and Technologies:
OpenCV will serve as the primary library for computer vision tasks, particularly for pose estimation. Machine learning frameworks may be incorporated to enhance pose estimation accuracy and gym tracking capabilities. We may use other libraries as we make progress in our project.
## Data Collection and Analysis:
Data collection involves capturing workout sessions with diverse exercises and body movements. Analysis will focus on the accuracy of pose estimation, real-time performance, and the overall user experience.
## Validation and Testing:
Validation will be conducted through user testing, assessing the system's effectiveness in providing accurate pose estimations and valuable insights during workout sessions.
